If the `vendor` folder is not being included in the wheel file, it's likely due to the way the `setup.py` file is configured. To ensure that the `vendor` folder is included in the wheel file, you need to explicitly tell `setuptools` to include it. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### 1. **Modify `setup.py` to Include the `vendor` Directory**

You need to modify the `setup.py` file to ensure that all the files in the `vendor` directory are included in the wheel. You can do this by specifying `package_data` or by using `MANIFEST.in`.

#### Option 1: Use `package_data`

You can include the `vendor` directory and its contents using the `package_data` argument in `setup.py`:

**`setup.py`**

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="sqlfluff_project",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(where="src"),
    package_dir={"": "src"},
    include_package_data=True,
    package_data={
        # Include everything in the vendor directory
        'your_module': ['vendor/sqlfluff/**/*', 'vendor/sqlfluff/**/**/*'],
    },
    install_requires=[],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'lint-sql=your_module.your_script:main',
        ],
    },
)
```

#### Option 2: Use `MANIFEST.in`

Alternatively, you can use a `MANIFEST.in` file to include the `vendor` directory:

1. Create a `MANIFEST.in` file in the root of your project (at the same level as `setup.py`).

2. Add the following lines to the `MANIFEST.in` file:

**`MANIFEST.in`**

```plaintext
recursive-include src/your_module/vendor *
```

This tells `setuptools` to include all files under the `vendor` directory.

### 2. **Rebuild the Wheel**

After modifying `setup.py` or adding the `MANIFEST.in` file, rebuild the wheel file:

```bash
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

### 3. **Check the Contents of the Wheel**

To verify that the `vendor` directory is now included, you can inspect the contents of the wheel file:

- Unzip the wheel file:
  ```bash
  unzip dist/sqlfluff_project-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl -d extracted_wheel
  ```

- Check the `extracted_wheel` directory for the presence of the `vendor/sqlfluff` folder.

### 4. **Test the Installation**

Finally, install the wheel file and test it to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
pip install dist/sqlfluff_project-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
lint-sql path/to/sql_file.sql
```

### Summary

By updating `setup.py` to include the `vendor` directory or by using a `MANIFEST.in` file, you ensure that the `vendor` directory is packaged into the wheel file. This way, when the wheel is distributed and installed, all the necessary files, including `sqlfluff`, will be available for use.
